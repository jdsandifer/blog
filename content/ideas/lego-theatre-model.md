### Talking About

- models/mockups and how they are important
- why I liked the idea of a LEGO model
- pics of my model
- challenges of scale - some things you can't accurately depict at a small scale
  - the floor
  - lighting
- thanks for reading about my interests

### Key Point
I use my hobbies (LEGO) to help me excel at my work (theatre, at the time)
