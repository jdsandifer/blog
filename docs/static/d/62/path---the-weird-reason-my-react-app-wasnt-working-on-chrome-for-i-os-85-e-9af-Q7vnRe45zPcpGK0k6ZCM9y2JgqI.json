It's hard to test every single device so this is common, but at work we have a direct connection to our users and can specify how they access our app so it was surprising to have this happen.</p>\n<p>The main page that displays various event wasn't displaying anything at all. It seemed to only be affecting users connecting on iOS devices so that's what we had to go on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"troubleshooting-begins\"><a href=\"#troubleshooting-begins\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Troubleshooting Begins</h2>\n<p>One of my strengths in software development is isolating a problem to help solve it quickly. My process involved some straightforward questions and digging to verify the answers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is the HTML page loading ok? Looks like it.</li>\n<li>Is the React container showing up? Yep.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is the React app rendering? No...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Because of React itself? No.</li>\n<li>Or React-DOM? No, it's also working. (Simple substitution testing shows that React renders a simple element fine.)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>So everything's working, but the elements aren't showing up? Yep...</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From there, I dove into the code that controls which elements show up and where. The primary issue became apparent - events weren't showing up because their dates weren't getting figured out correctly. Correct filtering, but bad dates somehow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation\"><a href=\"#documentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Documentation</h2>\n<p>As I've grown as a devloper, I've come to love good documentation. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MDN</a> is an awesome reference for all things JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. So, of course, that's where I turn for help (after a quick Google search to scan <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Stack Overflow</a> for solutions - no need to solve a problem someone else has already solved).</p>\n<p>Here's a sample of the type of code I'm trying to verify: <code class=\"language-text\">const eventDate = new Date(&quot;2018-09-26&quot;)</code>.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the docs confirm that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ISO 8601</a> date format is an accepted parameter for creating a new date.</p>\n<p>Just for kicks, I try <code class=\"language-text\">const eventDate = new Date(2018, 8, 26)</code>, using an older style initialization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"voila-it-works-but-why\"><a href=\"#voila-it-works-but-why\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Voila! It Works! But Why?</h2>\n<p>Changing the date initialization format caused everything to work correctly again. That was great, but I wasn't satisfied.</p>\n<p>I love it when things work, but I also hate not knowing why they worked. What if something changes and the \"same\" solution fails next time because I didn't truly understand the underlying mechanism? Sometimes time is of the essence and moving forward is too important to linger, but most of the time I don't think I'm doing my job right unless I <em>know</em> why a bug fix works and how to prevent the same issue again next time.</p>\n<p>For this, I tried to consult some of my favorite tools for checking on specific compatibility issues: MDN's chart at the bottom of each page, <a href=\"https://www.caniuse.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Can I use</a>, and if those don't work - Stack Overflow again.</p>\n<p>It took me a while, but I eventually found this gem: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11259152/chrome-ios-is-it-just-a-uiwebview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chrome iOS - Is it just a UIWebView?</a>. It turns out that Apple requires all apps on the App Store to use their renderer for showing web contect (the same as Mobile Safari uses). Essentially, supporting Chrome actually means supporting Safari on iOS, too. Any client-side rendering of JavaScript is handled by the same engine - no matter what browser you use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\"><a href=\"#takeaways\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Takeaways</h2>\n<p>What did I learn through this process?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm actually OK at solving tricky compatibility issues. Sometimes I've felt like I haven't had a really tricky bug in a while and it's nice to get something like this and see that I can come out the other side on top.</li>\n<li>Even narrowing supported browsers and OS's can leave you with surprises you didn't foresee.</li>\n<li>Software Development is still fun and challenging to me. I considered going into development as a career, but originally chose technical theatre instead because I thought development would get boring too fast. I'm glad that I've not only changed my mind on that front, but am consistently reminded that my initial thought was wrong.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>","excerpt":"If you haven't checked out my portfolio, you may not know that I pioneered a move to React for a web app I support at work.
