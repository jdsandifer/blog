How I used Netlify, cjpeg, and more.

## Netlify

## Pushing From GitHub

## Web Page Testing

## Progressive JPEG Compression
Great [article about progressive JPEG's](https://cloudinary.com/blog/progressive_jpegs_and_green_martians) - it has green martians!

## I Had Fun
Even as I write this blog post, I'm simply editing a file on GitHub. Sometimes I use my development environment, but sometimes I just edit right on GitHub - it doesn't publish until I push to the master branch so I'm safe!
