As promised, here is Part 2 of re-designing my web site. Check out [Part 1]() if you missed it.

## Netlify
As I mentioned in a previous post, I like to meet up with other developers outside my work from time to time to learn as much as I can about software, the industry, and new technologies. It's also fun swapping stories.

During one such conversation (the same one I talk about in Part 1), I mentioned that I was looking for an easy way to host my site. It had to be free and ideally it supported some kind of continuous deployment solution.

His suggestion: **Netlify**. Here are some of the features they offer:
* *FREE* (for me) - This one is big for me right now. I don't need much and don't want to pay much.
* Continuous deployment with GitHub integration - I talk more about this below.
* DNS Servers and Domain Management - My current domain name company does not have a great website. I love being able to just point my domain to Netlify's servers and manage everything via Netlify.

## Pushing From GitHub
It's amazing! And I get activity on my GitHub in the process!

## Web Page Testing
Any time you need to test a website, go to [Web Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/).

## Progressive JPEG Compression
Great [article about progressive JPEG's](https://cloudinary.com/blog/progressive_jpegs_and_green_martians) - it has green martians!

Install mozjpeg using Homebrew on MacOS. (I wasted a lot of time learning aobut compiling from source code before I realized a Homebrew install was possible.)

## I Had Fun
Even as I write this blog post, I'm simply editing a file on GitHub. Sometimes I use my development environment, but other times I just edit right on GitHub - it doesn't publish until I push to the master branch so it's safe to draft, revise, and tweak right on GitHub!
