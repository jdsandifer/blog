To get this blog started, I wanted a test post to see how things would look so I 
grabbed a resource page I created a while ago that needed some re-styling.

I originally created it without any styles applied - very web 1.0 - in order to 
get it done. (Thinking about how I wanted it to look was keeping me from 
getting started so I just skipped that.) 
Now that I'm starting this blog, I thought it would be a good test post. 
It would finally get some styling and I wouldn't have to write a new post to figure out the look of the blog.

So here it is, a resources page I created for sound technicians, musicians, and presenters:

## How to Use a Microphone (And More)
If you stumbled upon this page and aren't a sound technician, but interact with sound equipment in one way or another, then these links might be for you. (Also useful for sound techs when you need to explain a concept to a speaker or musician.)

* [Speaker & Musician Training Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHUyHKAjpavTSVOW_5cgB9P8Rv3ekzp_) - Just jump to the video that fits your needs.

## Learning to Hear Sound
It's a visual world - learning to hear as a primary source of information is difficult (unless you can't see). Here are some things to help with that.

* This section is still under construction...

## What Is Good Sound?
Resources to help you know what things should sound like. Knowing what you're aiming for is half the battle.

* [Good Sound Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHUyHKAjpau_tHCYZWWYq3v9_1iz53yn) - Examples of quality instruments and vocals. You can't make amateur performers or budget instruments sound like they aren't, but you *can* help them get a little closer! If you know what you're aiming for, that is.

## How to Mix
What's gain? How do I make that sound less harsh? What do you call the thing that makes levels more balanced? Answers to those questions and more...

* [Getting Good Sounds Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHUyHKAjpavtIBJBak50MR3-X-bJHmKE) - As always, skip to the videos that picque your interest.

## Practice Mixing
Links for how to practice mixing when you don't have a band and console in front of you. Practice makes better, but you can't just take the console home with you...

* [Reaper Digital Audio Workstation](https://www.reaper.fm/) - Reaper is my DAW software of choice: It's truly free to demo and inexpensive to buy.
* [Beginner Multitrack Recordings](http://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms-mtk.htm) - I can't speak for the content of the music so listener beware, but these are geared toward newbies. (The page is a little confusing - you want the big box in the middle partway down for previews and download links.)
* [Lots of Multitrack Sites](https://behindthespeakers.com/300-free-multitracks/) - It might be a little intimidating, but just click on the first link that looks good and continue until you find a multitrack you like or hit a dead end. Repeat as needed!

## Sound Consoles
Tutorials on how to get things done on specific consoles.

* Yamaha LS9 Video Playlist (coming soon) - The console I use at my church.

## Acoustics & Other Advanced Topics
These links may or may not make you a better sound technician, but they might be useful if you ever get the chance to do some trickier stuff - like supervise a sound system install or contribute to the design of a venue.

* [Acoustics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHUyHKAjpatb2R1eEndHVohXt9_K1a6o) - Probably best to watch these in order.
