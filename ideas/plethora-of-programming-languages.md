## The Beginnings of Software Development
According to Wikipedia, the first computer programming language was _____ and it was created in 19__ (1).



## My First Programming Language
At some point after I learned to read, but before middle school, 
I took an interest in computers and used my dad's IBM PC ([this one]()) to 
learn BASIC, a programming language designed to be simple. It had a good name, right?

I started poking around on my own, but soon teamed up with my best friend from across the street.
We made simple computer programs in BASIC and then C++ and eventually in Java - the newest language
at the time (that I knew about).

We didn't create anything ground-breaking, but I learned the ins and outs of logical procedures, 
debugging code with sometimes cryptic errors, and how to communicate ideas about how a program 
should function and look like.

## My First "Job"
In middle school, I had an awesome Geography teacher named Mr. Rogers. He was technologically advanced for a
teacher at this time (in my city) because he regularly used a digital projector and screen to display
information at a time when chalkboards were still commmon and overhead projectors were the only similar technology
most teachers had access to. (Mr. Rogers inherited the old projector from the theatre.)
He also regularly gave tests via computer - maybe exclusively, I don't remember for sure. On test days, we would all go 
over to the computer lab and use the PC's with Windows 3.0 to demonstrate our knowledge about countries in 
various time periods - their names, locations, and major events associated with them.

So it's not surprising to me that Mr. Rogers allowed students to turn in some assignments in the form of web pages. 
Looking back at this, I realize what a brilliant move that was, but at the time I simply thought: "Cool, a way to type 
up my report and not have to print it out or hand it in. No 'dog ate my homework' type issues for me!"

It's because of that report, that Mr. Rogers gave me my first "job" in software: Redesign the school's web page.

If I remember correctly, I used HTML only for the project - no CSS and definitely no JavaScript. I think both were available, 
but this was around the time that Animated GIF's were still the new hotness so it seemed like every web page had at least 
one waving flag, animated smiley face, or dancing cartoon character. I simply had to choose a reasonable color scheme and avoid 
the temptation to insert unnecessary graphics and my school's web page went from looking like the average MySpace page to 
looking super professional.

(Fun side note: Creating the contact list page for the site is how I found out that my geography teacher was married to my 
[home ec]() teacher. It was the first time I'd ever heard of teachers at the same school being in any kind of relationship and 
was weird to me at the time.)

## Context
If you've grown up with most of the technology I'm been talking about so far, you might be wondering how long ago it was
that I'm talking about. For a little context, Google came out around the this time. Yep, I remember doing my first Google search
and that was in ____ about 25 years ago.

If it sound like I'm describing your early years in school exactly, well, that's awesome.

And if you remember walking to school everyday, up hill both ways, in the snow, then you definitely want keep reading.

## Proliferation of Software
From 20__ to ____, the number of software titles for computers has ____. And the number of programming languages used to create 
that software has gone from about ____ to nearly ____!

Currently, I'm focused on one language - JavaScript. In that language space alone, there are roughly ____ language variants and  
supersets in common use (TypeScript, Flow, ES5, ES2015, etc.) as I write this. There are also ___ major libraries or frameworks 
that are an ecosystem in and of themselves - we're talking about React, React Native, Redux, etc.

Stack Overflow, a site where developers can answer each other's software development questions, 
has grown from it's beginnings in ____ to a staggering ____ users in 2019 as I write this.
